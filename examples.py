EXAMPLE_SUMMARY = """The latest papers in the AI/NLP field address challenges in real-time processing [id=1], reasoning enhancement [id=3], multilingual capabilities [id=2], and automated academic communication [id=4]. [id=1] enables efficient long-form video understanding through a KV cache and SFT strategy, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a novel benchmark. [id=3] improves LLM reasoning by leveraging prompt variation during testing, boosting accuracy in complex tasks like mathematics by over 40%. Meanwhile, [id=4] evaluates LLMs in competitive programming, revealing that models like GPT-5 excel but still lag behind human experts.

EXAMPLE_OUTOFTHE_BOX = """A wild idea with real-time video understanding and text output is a product for gym owners, where cameras are constantly observing the user performing a fitness exercise and providing accurate and in-real-time feedback with respect to their form. They can even count reps for you, or suggest next exercises based on what you are doing at the moment! [id=1] could be a key component of such a system, enabling efficient processing of long-form video data.
